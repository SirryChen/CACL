#### reproduce note
Since this method doesn't use any information from graph, the final results will be same with those in Twibot-22 benchmark.
So we simply use the given scores as the results of our reproduction.

**implement details in Twibot-22 benchmark**: 
   - We ignored the content-based features due to the lack of the information in our datasets 
   - We did not use the SMOTEENN method to balance the negative samples, since our datasets are well balanced and adding SMOTEENN did not improve the results
   - All datasets except Twibot-20 lack some of the core features in account based features such as default profile and geo-enabled, and some of the usersâ€™ data is missing ( i.e. no friends count t, follower count etc. ) and were set to 0 in our experiments
